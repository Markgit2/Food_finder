Purpose of this code is to help me find places to eat.

This code takes 2 parameters: Food and Location. It will then pull the data off Google Places API to return some search results for restaurants / cafes that serve this partifular food item. 

To build: Create an option that recommends top 5 places with the particular food item inside for days when users are free and easy or want to try something new / random
